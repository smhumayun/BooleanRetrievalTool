# BooleanRetrievalTool

An example tool to illustrate the concepts of Boolean Retrieval (http://www.cis.lmu.de/~hs/teach/14s/ir/) as taught to us by Dr Tafseer Ahmed Khan (http://cs.dsu.edu.pk/faculty/tafseer/). 

I've used:

Apache OpenNLP (https://opennlp.apache.org/) - For Tokenization of documents and dictionary creation

ANTLR 4 - (http://www.antlr.org/) - For Boolean Retrieval Query Grammer, Lexer and Parser

XStream - (http://x-stream.github.io/) - For reading input config from XML configuration file
